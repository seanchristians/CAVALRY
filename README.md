# CAVALRY

Quickly load secrets as environment variables

# Getting Started

```sh
pip3 install cavalry
```

# Usage

Run `cav -h` to see options. Note: the script is not POSIX compatible and requires `/bin/bash`.

## Loading variables

The `load` command will run an eval on the variables exported from the function. To get these into your current scope, the file must be run with `source ...`. Shorthand in most terminals is to simply prepend a dot: `. cav load ...`. **TL;DR**: to load variables, run `. cav load ...`

## Script

```sh
usage: cav [-h] [-s FILE] {store,delete,load,list,clear} ...

Utility to load environment variables. To persist the variables into your
scope, run 'source cav {load,clear} [options]' or '. cav {load,clear} [options]'

positional arguments:
  {store,delete,load,list,clear}
    store               store variables
    delete              delete variables
    load                load variables
    list                list stored data
    clear               clear variables from environment

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s FILE, --secrets FILE
                        specify an alternate secrets file
```
