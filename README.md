# CAVALRY

Quickly load secrets as environment variables

# Getting Started

```sh
pip3 install cavalry
```

# Usage

Run `cav -h` to see options. Note: the script is not POSIX compatible and requires `/bin/bash`.

## Loading Variables

Changing environment variables in the current scope from a file must be done through your shell's `source` function. Therefore, you have to run `source cav load` instead of just `cav load`.

# Contributing

If you would like to contribute to the project, please go check out [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md). Issue templates are available.
